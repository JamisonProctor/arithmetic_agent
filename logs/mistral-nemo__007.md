# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
One side of a rectangle is 3 cm shorter than the other side.  
If we increase the length of each side by 1 cm, then the area of the rectangle will increase by 18 cm².  
Find the lengths of all sides.

### Step 1 (HUMAN)
One side of a rectangle is 3 cm shorter than the other side.  
If we increase the length of each side by 1 cm, then the area of the rectangle will increase by 18 cm².  
Find the lengths of all sides.

### Step 2 (AI)
[TOOL_CALLS] Let's denote the length of the shorter side as x. Then, the longer side would be x + 3.

First, let's find the original area of the rectangle before increasing the length of each side by 1 cm:
Original Area = Length × Width
              = x(x + 3)

After increasing the length of each side by 1 cm, both sides become (x + 1) and (x + 4). The new area is then:
New Area = (Length + 1)(Width + 1)
          = (x + 1)(x + 4)

We are given that the increase in area is 18 cm². So, we can set up the following equation:

(x + 1)(x + 4) - x(x + 3) = 18

Now, let's solve for x using the tools available.

First, let's expand both expressions:
Original Area = x^2 + 3x
New Area     = x^2 + 5x + 4

Subtracting the Original Area from the New Area gives us:
(x^2 + 5x + 4) - (x^2 + 3x) = 18
x^2 + 5x + 4 - x^2 - 3x = 18
2x + 4 = 18

Now, let's subtract 4 from both sides:
2x = 14

Next, we'll divide by 2 to solve for x:
`divide(14, 2)`

Waiting for the result...

## Ground Truth Solution
The sides of the rectangle are 10 cm and 7 cm.
