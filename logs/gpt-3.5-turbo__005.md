## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
A student chose a number, multiplied it by 2, then subtracted 138 from the result and got 102.  
What was the number he chose?

## Agent Messages
### Step 1 (HUMAN)
A student chose a number, multiplied it by 2, then subtracted 138 from the result and got 102.  
What was the number he chose?

### Step 2 (AI)
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The student chose a number.
2. The student multiplied the chosen number by 2.
3. The student subtracted 138 from the result and got 102.

To find the number the student chose, we need to work backward from the final result of 102.

Let's denote the chosen number as \( x \).

The steps can be represented as follows:
1. \( 2x \) (multiplying the chosen number by 2)
2. \( 2x - 138 \) (subtracting 138 from the result)

Given that \( 2x - 138 = 102 \), we can solve for \( x \) by reversing the operations.

Let's calculate the value of \( x \) by working backward.

### Step 3 (TOOL)
240

### Step 4 (AI)


### Step 5 (TOOL)
120.0

### Step 6 (AI)
The number the student chose was 120.

## Ground Truth Solution

The number he chose was 120.
