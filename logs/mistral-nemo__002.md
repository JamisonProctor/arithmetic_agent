## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
Mary, Peter, and Lucy were picking chestnuts.  
Mary picked twice as much chestnuts as Peter.  
Lucy picked 2 kg more than Peter.  
Together the three of them picked 26 kg of chestnuts.  
How many kilograms did each of them pick?

### Step 1 (HUMAN)
Mary, Peter, and Lucy were picking chestnuts.  
Mary picked twice as much chestnuts as Peter.  
Lucy picked 2 kg more than Peter.  
Together the three of them picked 26 kg of chestnuts.  
How many kilograms did each of them pick?

### Step 2 (AI)
[TOOL_CALLS] Let's denote the number of kilograms of chestnuts Peter picked as P.

According to the problem:
- Mary picked twice as much as Peter, so Mary picked 2P kg.
- Lucy picked 2 kg more than Peter, so Lucy picked P + 2 kg.
- Together they picked 26 kg, so we can write the equation: P + 2P + (P + 2) = 26

Now, let's solve for P step by step.

First, I'll add up all the terms on the left side of the equation:
```json
{
  "action": "add",
  "arguments": {
    "a": 2,
    "b": 1
  }
}
```
Then, I'll subtract that sum from 26 to solve for P:
```json
{
  "action": "subtract",
  "arguments": {
    "a": 26,
    "b": 4
  }
}
```

## Ground Truth Solution

- Peter picked 6 kg
- Mary picked 12 kg
- Lucy picked 8 kg
