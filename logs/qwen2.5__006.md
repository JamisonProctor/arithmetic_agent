## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
The distance between two towns is 380 km.  
At the same moment, a passenger car and a truck start moving towards each other from different towns.  
They meet 4 hours later.  

If the car drives 5 km/hr faster than the truck, what are their speeds?

### Step 1 (HUMAN)
The distance between two towns is 380 km.  
At the same moment, a passenger car and a truck start moving towards each other from different towns.  
They meet 4 hours later.  

If the car drives 5 km/hr faster than the truck, what are their speeds?

### Step 2 (AI)


### Step 3 (TOOL CALL)
[TOOL CALL] multiply(a=vt + 5, b=4) -> ERROR: multiply: both arguments must be int or float

### Step 4 (TOOL)
[TOOL ERROR] multiply: both arguments must be int or float

### Step 5 (AI)


### Step 6 (TOOL CALL)
[TOOL CALL] multiply(a=2 * vt + 5, b=4) -> ERROR: multiply: both arguments must be int or float

### Step 7 (TOOL)
[TOOL ERROR] multiply: both arguments must be int or float

### Step 8 (AI)
Let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( vt \) represent the speed of the truck in km/hr.
2. The car drives 5 km/hr faster than the truck, so its speed is \( vt + 5 \) km/hr.

Since they meet after 4 hours, we can write the equation for the total distance covered by both vehicles as:
\[ (vt + (vt + 5)) \times 4 = 380 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ (2 \cdot vt + 5) \times 4 = 380 \]

Now I will use the `multiply` function with correct arguments.
<tool_call>
{"name": "multiply", "arguments": {"a": 2 * vt + 5, "b": 4}}
</tool_call>

## Ground Truth Solution
- Truck speed = 45 km/hr 
- Car speed = 50 km/hr
