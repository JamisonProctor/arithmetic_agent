## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
A farming field can be ploughed by 6 tractors in 4 days.  
When 6 tractors work together, each of them ploughs 120 hectares a day.  

If two of the tractors were moved to another field, then the remaining 4 tractors could plough the same field in 5 days.  

How many hectares a day would one tractor plough then?

### Step 1 (HUMAN)
A farming field can be ploughed by 6 tractors in 4 days.  
When 6 tractors work together, each of them ploughs 120 hectares a day.  

If two of the tractors were moved to another field, then the remaining 4 tractors could plough the same field in 5 days.  

How many hectares a day would one tractor plough then?

### Step 2 (AI)
Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. We know that 6 tractors can plough 120 hectares per day together (since they can finish the field in 4 days). So, the total area of the field is 6 tractors * 120 hectares/day = 720 hectares.

2. If two tractors were moved away, we are left with 4 tractors. According to the problem, these 4 tractors can also plough the same field in 5 days. So, the total area of the field remains 720 hectares.

3. Now, let's find out how much one tractor can plough in a day when there are only 4 tractors working. The work done by 4 tractors in one day is 720 hectares / 5 days = 144 hectares/day.

4. Therefore, the amount one tractor can plough in a day when there are 4 tractors is 144 hectares/day divided by 4 tractors = 36 hectares/day.

So, one tractor would plough 36 hectares a day when there are only 4 tractors working. 

Let's call the tools to confirm our calculations:

- `divide(144, 4)` to find out how many hectares one tractor can plough in a day when there are 4 tractors.

## Ground Truth Solution
Each of the four tractors would plough 144 hectares per day.
