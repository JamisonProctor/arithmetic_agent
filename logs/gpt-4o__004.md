## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
A farming field can be ploughed by 6 tractors in 4 days.  
When 6 tractors work together, each of them ploughs 120 hectares a day.  

If two of the tractors were moved to another field, then the remaining 4 tractors could plough the same field in 5 days.  

How many hectares a day would one tractor plough then?

### Step 1 (HUMAN)
A farming field can be ploughed by 6 tractors in 4 days.  
When 6 tractors work together, each of them ploughs 120 hectares a day.  

If two of the tractors were moved to another field, then the remaining 4 tractors could plough the same field in 5 days.  

How many hectares a day would one tractor plough then?

### Step 2 (AI)
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hectares a day one tractor would plough if only 4 tractors are working and they complete the field in 5 days.

First, let's calculate the total area of the field in hectares. We know that 6 tractors working together plough 120 hectares a day. Therefore, in 4 days, they would plough:

\[ \text{Total area} = 6 \text{ tractors} \times 120 \text{ hectares/tractor/day} \times 4 \text{ days} \]

Let's calculate this total area.

### Step 3 (TOOL)
720

### Step 4 (AI)


### Step 5 (TOOL)
2880

### Step 6 (AI)
The total area of the field is 2880 hectares.

Now, let's consider the scenario where 4 tractors are working and they complete the field in 5 days. We need to find out how many hectares a day one tractor would plough in this case.

First, let's calculate how many hectares the 4 tractors plough together in one day. Since they complete the field in 5 days, they plough:

\[ \text{Hectares per day for 4 tractors} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{2880 \text{ hectares}}{5 \text{ days}} \]

Let's calculate this.

### Step 7 (TOOL)
576.0

### Step 8 (AI)
The 4 tractors plough 576 hectares together in one day.

Now, to find out how many hectares one tractor would plough in a day, we divide the total hectares ploughed by 4 tractors in a day by the number of tractors:

\[ \text{Hectares per day for 1 tractor} = \frac{576 \text{ hectares}}{4 \text{ tractors}} \]

Let's calculate this.

### Step 9 (TOOL)
144.0

### Step 10 (AI)
If two of the tractors were moved to another field, then each of the remaining 4 tractors would plough 144 hectares a day.

## Ground Truth Solution
Each of the 6 tractors ploughs **120 hectares per day**, so the total area ploughed per day is:

**6 × 120 = 720 hectares/day**

Since they worked for 4 days, the total area of the field is:

**720 × 4 = 2880 hectares**

Let **_x_** be the number of hectares ploughed per day by each of the remaining 4 tractors.

In 5 days, the total area ploughed by 4 tractors is:

**5 × 4 × x = 20x**

Set that equal to the total field area:

**20x = 2880**

Solve for **_x_**:

**x = 2880 ÷ 20 = 144**

### **Answer:** Each of the four tractors would plough **144 hectares per day**.
