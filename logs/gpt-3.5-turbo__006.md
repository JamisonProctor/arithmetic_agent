## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
The distance between two towns is 380 km.  
At the same moment, a passenger car and a truck start moving towards each other from different towns.  
They meet 4 hours later.  

If the car drives 5 km/hr faster than the truck, what are their speeds?

### Step 1 (HUMAN)
The distance between two towns is 380 km.  
At the same moment, a passenger car and a truck start moving towards each other from different towns.  
They meet 4 hours later.  

If the car drives 5 km/hr faster than the truck, what are their speeds?

### Step 2 (AI)
Let's denote the speed of the truck as \( x \) km/hr.  
Since the car drives 5 km/hr faster, the speed of the car is \( x + 5 \) km/hr.

The total distance traveled by both the car and the truck when they meet is 380 km.  
The time taken for them to meet is 4 hours.

We can set up the following equation based on the distance formula:  
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the truck:  
\[ x \times 4 = 380 \]  
\[ 4x = 380 \]

For the car:  
\[ (x + 5) \times 4 = 380 \]  
\[ 4(x + 5) = 380 \]

Let's solve these equations step by step using the tools.

### Step 3 (TOOL)
380

### Step 4 (AI)


### Step 5 (TOOL)
95.0

### Step 6 (AI)


### Step 7 (TOOL)
90

### Step 8 (AI)


### Step 9 (TOOL)
95.0

### Step 10 (TOOL)
95

### Step 11 (AI)
The speed of the truck is 95 km/hr, and the speed of the car is 95 km/hr + 5 km/hr = 100 km/hr. 

Therefore, the speed of the truck is 95 km/hr, and the speed of the car is 100 km/hr.

## Ground Truth Solution

- Truck speed = 45 km/hr 
- Car speed = 50 km/hr
