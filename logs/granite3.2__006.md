# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
The distance between two towns is 380 km.  
At the same moment, a passenger car and a truck start moving towards each other from different towns.  
They meet 4 hours later.  

If the car drives 5 km/hr faster than the truck, what are their speeds?

### Step 1 (HUMAN)
The distance between two towns is 380 km.  
At the same moment, a passenger car and a truck start moving towards each other from different towns.  
They meet 4 hours later.  

If the car drives 5 km/hr faster than the truck, what are their speeds?

### Step 2 (AI)
1. Let's denote the speed of the truck as x km/h. Therefore, the speed of the car would be (x + 5) km/h.
2. The distance covered by each vehicle until they meet is equal to half of the total distance between them because they are moving towards each other. So, each vehicle covers a distance of 380 / 2 = 190 km.
3. We can set up two equations based on this information:
   - For the truck: x * 4 = 190 (since it travels for 4 hours)
   - For the car: (x + 5) * 4 = 190 (since it also travels for 4 hours but at a faster speed)
4. Let's solve these equations one by one using the tools provided.

   First, I'll call `divide(380, 2)` to find half of the total distance:
   ```add(380, 0)```
5. Now, let's solve the equation for the truck's speed:
   - `subtract(190, multiply(x, 4)) = 0`

   I'll call `divide(190, 4)` to isolate x:
   ```add(190, 0)```
6. Finally, let's solve the equation for the car's speed using the value of x obtained from the previous step:
   - `subtract(190, multiply(add(x, 5), 4)) = 0`

   I'll call `divide(190, 4)` and then add 5 to get the car's speed:
   ```add(190, 0)```

Final Answer:
- Truck's speed: x km/h
- Car's speed: (x + 5) km/h

## Ground Truth Solution
- Truck speed = 45 km/hr 
- Car speed = 50 km/hr
