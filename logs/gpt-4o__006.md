## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
The distance between two towns is 380 km.  
At the same moment, a passenger car and a truck start moving towards each other from different towns.  
They meet 4 hours later.  

If the car drives 5 km/hr faster than the truck, what are their speeds?

### Step 1 (HUMAN)
The distance between two towns is 380 km.  
At the same moment, a passenger car and a truck start moving towards each other from different towns.  
They meet 4 hours later.  

If the car drives 5 km/hr faster than the truck, what are their speeds?

### Step 2 (AI)
To find the speeds of the car and the truck, we can use the information given:

1. The total distance between the two towns is 380 km.
2. The car and the truck meet after 4 hours.
3. The car drives 5 km/hr faster than the truck.

Let's denote the speed of the truck as \( x \) km/hr. Then, the speed of the car will be \( x + 5 \) km/hr.

Since they meet after 4 hours, the total distance covered by both vehicles in 4 hours is 380 km. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 4x + 4(x + 5) = 380 \]

Let's simplify and solve this equation step by step.

First, expand the equation:

\[ 4x + 4x + 20 = 380 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 8x + 20 = 380 \]

Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation. Let's perform this subtraction.

### Step 2.1 (TOOL CALL)
subtract(a=380, b=20)

### Step 3 (TOOL)
360

### Step 4 (AI)
After subtracting 20 from both sides, we have:

\[ 8x = 360 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 8. Let's perform this division.

### Step 4.1 (TOOL CALL)
divide(a=360, b=8)

### Step 5 (TOOL)
45.0

### Step 6 (AI)
The speed of the truck is \( x = 45 \) km/hr.

Since the car drives 5 km/hr faster than the truck, the speed of the car is \( x + 5 \).

Let's calculate the speed of the car by adding 5 to the truck's speed.

### Step 6.1 (TOOL CALL)
add(a=45, b=5)

### Step 7 (TOOL)
50

### Step 8 (AI)
The speed of the car is \( 50 \) km/hr.

Therefore, the speeds are:
- Truck: 45 km/hr
- Car: 50 km/hr

## Ground Truth Solution
- Truck speed = 45 km/hr 
- Car speed = 50 km/hr
