## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
Sophia finished two-thirds of a book.  
She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read.  
How long is her book?

## Agent Messages
### Step 1 (HUMAN)
Sophia finished two-thirds of a book.  
She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read.  
How long is her book?

### Step 2 (AI)
Let's denote the total number of pages in the book as P. 

According to the problem, Sophia has read two-thirds of the book, so she has read (2/3)P pages. This means she has yet to read one-third of the book, or (1/3)P pages.

The problem states that the number of pages Sophia has read is 90 more than what she has left to read. So we can write this as an equation:

(2/3)P = (1/3)P + 90

Before calling any tool, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Subtract (1/3)P from both sides of the equation to get all P terms on one side:

   (2/3)P - (1/3)P = 90

2. Combine like terms:

   (1/3)P = 90

Now, we need to find the value of P. To do this, I will call the `divide` tool:

`divide(90, 1/3)`

After getting the result, I'll provide the total number of pages in Sophia's book.

## Ground Truth Solution
The book has 270 pages in total.
