## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
Sophia finished two-thirds of a book.  
She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read.  
How long is her book?

## Agent Messages
### Step 1 (HUMAN)
Sophia finished two-thirds of a book.  
She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read.  
How long is her book?

### Step 2 (AI)
Let's denote the total number of pages in the book as \( x \).

1. Sophia finished two-thirds of the book, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times x \) pages.
2. She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read, so the difference between the pages she finished and the pages she has yet to read is 90 pages.

Let's set up the equations:

1. \( \frac{2}{3} \times x = x - \frac{1}{3} \times x = x - \frac{x}{3} \)
2. \( \frac{x}{3} = 90 \)

Now, we can solve for the total number of pages in the book.

### Step 3 (TOOL)
90.0

### Step 4 (AI)


### Step 5 (TOOL)
270

### Step 6 (AI)
The total number of pages in the book is 270 pages.  
Therefore, Sophia's book is 270 pages long.

## Ground Truth Solution

The book has 270 pages in total.
