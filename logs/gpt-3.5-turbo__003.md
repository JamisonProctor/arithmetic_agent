## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
Sophia finished two-thirds of a book.  
She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read.  
How long is her book?

## Agent Messages
### Step 1 (HUMAN)
Sophia finished two-thirds of a book.  
She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read.  
How long is her book?

### Step 2 (AI)
Let's denote the total number of pages in the book as \( x \).

1. Sophia finished two-thirds of the book, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times x \) pages.
2. She has yet to read one-third of the book, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times x \) pages.
3. According to the calculation, she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read, so we have the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times x = \frac{1}{3} \times x + 90 \]

To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to solve this equation. Let's calculate it step by step.

### Step 2.1 (TOOL CALL)
multiply(a=2, b=1)

### Step 3 (TOOL)
2

### Step 4 (AI)


### Step 4.1 (TOOL CALL)
divide(a=2, b=3)

### Step 5 (TOOL)
0.6666666666666666

### Step 6 (AI)


### Step 6.1 (TOOL CALL)
multiply(a=1, b=1)

### Step 7 (TOOL)
1

### Step 8 (AI)


### Step 8.1 (TOOL CALL)
multiply(a=1, b=1)

### Step 9 (TOOL)
1

### Step 10 (TOOL)
90.66666666666667

### Step 11 (AI)


### Step 11.1 (TOOL CALL)
add(a=90, b=0.6666666666666666)

### Step 12 (TOOL)
272.00000000000006

### Step 13 (AI)
The total number of pages in Sophia's book is 272 pages.

### Step 13.1 (TOOL CALL)
divide(a=90.66666666666667, b=0.3333333333333333)

## Ground Truth Solution
The book has 270 pages in total.
