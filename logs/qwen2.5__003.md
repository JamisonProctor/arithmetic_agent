## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
Sophia finished two-thirds of a book.  
She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read.  
How long is her book?

## Agent Messages
### Step 1 (HUMAN)
Sophia finished two-thirds of a book.  
She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read.  
How long is her book?

### Step 2 (AI)


### Step 3 (TOOL CALL)
[TOOL CALL] subtract(a=2/3*P, b=1/3*P) -> ERROR: subtract: both arguments must be int or float

### Step 4 (TOOL)
[TOOL ERROR] subtract: both arguments must be int or float

### Step 5 (AI)


### Step 6 (TOOL CALL)
[TOOL CALL] multiply(a=90, b=3) -> 270

### Step 7 (TOOL)
270

### Step 8 (TOOL CALL)
Let's denote the total length of the book as \( P \).

Sophia finished two-thirds of the book and has one-third left to read. The difference between what she has read and what she has left is 90 pages.

This can be expressed with the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P - \frac{1}{3}P = 90 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{3}P = 90 \]

To find \( P \), we multiply both sides by 3:
\[ P = 90 \times 3 \]

[TOOL CALL] multiply(a=90, b=3) -> 270

## Ground Truth Solution
The book has 270 pages in total.
