## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

Let's re-evaluate the problem step by step.

Sophia finished two-thirds of a book, which means she has one-third left to read. We know that the number of pages she finished is 90 more than the number of pages she has yet to read. Let \( x \) be the total number of pages in the book.

The equation based on the information given can be written as:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{1}{3}x + 90 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \(\frac{1}{3}x\) from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x - \frac{1}{3}x = 90 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3}x = 90 \]

Next, to find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 3:
\[ x = 90 \times 3 \]
\[ x = 270 \]

So the total number of pages in the book is 270.

## Ground Truth Solution

The book has 270 pages in total.
