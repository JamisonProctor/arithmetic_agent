## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
Sophia finished two-thirds of a book.  
She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read.  
How long is her book?

## Agent Messages
### Step 1 (HUMAN)
Sophia finished two-thirds of a book.  
She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read.  
How long is her book?

### Step 2 (AI)
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Sophia has left to read and then add that to the number of pages she has already read.

Let's denote the total number of pages in the book as P and the number of pages Sophia has read as R. According to the information given:

1. Sophia finished two-thirds of the book, so:
   R = (2/3) * P

2. She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read, which means:
   R = P - (P - R)
   R + (P - R) = 90
   P = 90

Now we know the total number of pages in the book is 90. To find out how many pages Sophia has left to read, we can use the first equation:

R = (2/3) * P
R = (2/3) * 90
R = 60

So, Sophia has read 60 pages and has 30 pages left to read. The total length of her book is the sum of these two amounts:

Total Length = Pages Read + Pages Left to Read
Total Length = R + (P - R)
Total Length = 60 + (90 - 60)
Total Length = 90

Therefore, Sophia's book is 90 pages long.

## Ground Truth Solution
Let **_x_** be the total number of pages in the book.

- Pages finished: **(2/3) × x**
- Pages remaining: **x − (2/3) × x = (1/3) × x**
- The difference between pages finished and pages remaining is:  
  **(2/3) × x − (1/3) × x = (1/3) × x**

According to the problem, this difference is 90 pages:

**(1/3) × x = 90**

**x = 270**

### **Answer:** The book has **270 pages** in total.
