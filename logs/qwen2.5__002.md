## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
Mary, Peter, and Lucy were picking chestnuts.  
Mary picked twice as much chestnuts as Peter.  
Lucy picked 2 kg more than Peter.  
Together the three of them picked 26 kg of chestnuts.  
How many kilograms did each of them pick?

## Agent Messages
### Step 1 (HUMAN)
Mary, Peter, and Lucy were picking chestnuts.  
Mary picked twice as much chestnuts as Peter.  
Lucy picked 2 kg more than Peter.  
Together the three of them picked 26 kg of chestnuts.  
How many kilograms did each of them pick?

### Step 2 (AI)


### Step 3 (TOOL CALL)
[TOOL CALL] add(a=3*P, b=2)

### Step 4 (TOOL)
[TOOL ERROR] add: both arguments must be int or float

### Step 5 (AI)
Let's define the amount of chestnuts Peter picked as \( P \) kg. 

According to the problem:
- Mary picked twice as much as Peter, so she picked \( 2P \) kg.
- Lucy picked 2 kg more than Peter, so she picked \( P + 2 \) kg.

Together they picked a total of 26 kg, which gives us the equation:

\[ 2P + P + (P + 2) = 26 \]

Let's simplify and solve this equation for \( P \).
<tool_call>
{"name": "add", "arguments": {"a": 3*P, "b": 2}}
</tool_call>

## Ground Truth Solution
- Peter picked 6 kg
- Mary picked 12 kg
- Lucy picked 8 kg
