## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem

### Step 32 (AI)
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( P \) be the number of kilograms Peter picked.
2. Mary picked twice as much chestnuts as Peter, so she picked \( 2P \).
3. Lucy picked 2 kg more than Peter, so she picked \( P + 2 \).

Together they picked a total of 26 kg:
\[ P + 2P + (P + 2) = 26 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4P + 2 = 26 \]
\[ 4P = 24 \]
\[ P = 6 \]

So, Peter picked \( 6 \) kg.

Now we can find out how much Mary and Lucy picked:

- Mary: \( 2P = 2 \times 6 = 12 \) kg
- Lucy: \( P + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \) kg

Let's verify the total:
\[ 6 (Peter) + 12 (Mary) + 8 (Lucy) = 26 \]

Therefore, Peter picked 6 kg, Mary picked 12 kg, and Lucy picked 8 kg.

## Ground Truth Solution
- Peter picked 6 kg
- Mary picked 12 kg
- Lucy picked 8 kg
