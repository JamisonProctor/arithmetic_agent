## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
One side of a rectangle is 3 cm shorter than the other side.  
If we increase the length of each side by 1 cm, then the area of the rectangle will increase by 18 cm².  
Find the lengths of all sides.

### Step 4 (AI)
To solve this problem, we need to first define the variables and set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's say the length of the longer side is x cm, and the length of the shorter side is (x - 3) cm.

The area of the rectangle is given by:

Area = Length × Width

We are told that if we increase the length of each side by 1 cm, then the area of the rectangle will increase by 18 cm². This means that the new area is equal to the original area plus 18 cm².

Let's set up an equation based on this information:

(x + 1) × (x - 3 + 1) = x × (x - 3) + 18

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(x + 1) × (x - 2) = x^2 - 3x + 18

Expanding and simplifying further, we get:

x^2 - x - 2 = x^2 - 3x + 18

Subtracting x^2 from both sides gives us:

-x - 2 = -3x + 18

Adding 3x to both sides gives us:

2x - 2 = 18

Adding 2 to both sides gives us:

2x = 20

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 10

Now that we have found the value of x, we can find the length of the shorter side by subtracting 3 from x:

Shorter side = x - 3
= 10 - 3
= 7

Therefore, the lengths of all sides are:

Longer side: 10 cm
Shorter side: 7 cm

## Ground Truth Solution

The sides of the rectangle are 10 cm and 7 cm.
