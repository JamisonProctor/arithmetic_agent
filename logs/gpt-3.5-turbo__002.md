## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
Mary, Peter, and Lucy were picking chestnuts.  
Mary picked twice as much chestnuts as Peter.  
Lucy picked 2 kg more than Peter.  
Together the three of them picked 26 kg of chestnuts.  
How many kilograms did each of them pick?

### Step 1 (HUMAN)
Mary, Peter, and Lucy were picking chestnuts.  
Mary picked twice as much chestnuts as Peter.  
Lucy picked 2 kg more than Peter.  
Together the three of them picked 26 kg of chestnuts.  
How many kilograms did each of them pick?

### Step 2 (AI)
Let's assign variables to represent the amount of chestnuts picked by each person.  
Let's say:
- The amount picked by Peter is \( P \) kg.
- Mary picked twice as much as Peter, so Mary picked \( 2P \) kg.
- Lucy picked 2 kg more than Peter, so Lucy picked \( P + 2 \) kg.

We know that the total amount picked by all three is 26 kg, so we have the equation:
\[ P + 2P + (P + 2) = 26 \]

Now, we can solve this equation step by step using tools. Let's start by simplifying the equation.

### Step 12 (AI)
After solving the equation, we find that:
- Peter picked 4 kg of chestnuts.
- Mary picked 8 kg of chestnuts.
- Lucy picked 6 kg of chestnuts.

Therefore, Peter picked 4 kg, Mary picked 8 kg, and Lucy picked 6 kg of chestnuts.

## Ground Truth Solution
- Peter picked 6 kg
- Mary picked 12 kg
- Lucy picked 8 kg
