## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
A farming field can be ploughed by 6 tractors in 4 days.  
When 6 tractors work together, each of them ploughs 120 hectares a day.  

If two of the tractors were moved to another field, then the remaining 4 tractors could plough the same field in 5 days.  

How many hectares a day would one tractor plough then?

### Step 1 (HUMAN)
A farming field can be ploughed by 6 tractors in 4 days.  
When 6 tractors work together, each of them ploughs 120 hectares a day.  

If two of the tractors were moved to another field, then the remaining 4 tractors could plough the same field in 5 days.  

How many hectares a day would one tractor plough then?

### Step 2 (AI)


### Step 3 (TOOL)
720

### Step 4 (AI)


### Step 5 (TOOL)
180.0

### Step 6 (AI)


### Step 7 (TOOL)
144.0

### Step 8 (AI)
From the initial information, we know that 6 tractors can plough a total of \(6 \times 120 = 720\) hectares in one day.

When two tractors are moved to another field, only 4 tractors remain. These 4 tractors take 5 days to plough the same 720 hectares. Therefore, each tractor would plough \( \frac{720}{4} = 180 \) hectares a day under this scenario.

However, we are asked how many hectares one tractor would plough if only 4 tractors were working for 5 days to complete the same work. The total work done by 4 tractors in 5 days is \(144\) hectares per day (as calculated from the tool response).

So, each of the remaining 4 tractors would plough \(\frac{720}{4} = 180\) hectares a day if they were to complete the work alone. But since we are considering the scenario where these 4 tractors together take 5 days, then each tractor would plough \( \frac{144}{1} = 144 \) hectares a day.

Therefore, one tractor would plough 144 hectares a day in this new scenario.

## Ground Truth Solution

Each of the four tractors would plough 144 hectares per day.
