## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
A farming field can be ploughed by 6 tractors in 4 days.  
When 6 tractors work together, each of them ploughs 120 hectares a day.  

If two of the tractors were moved to another field, then the remaining 4 tractors could plough the same field in 5 days.  

How many hectares a day would one tractor plough then?

## Agent Messages
### Step 1 (HUMAN)
A farming field can be ploughed by 6 tractors in 4 days.  
When 6 tractors work together, each of them ploughs 120 hectares a day.  

If two of the tractors were moved to another field, then the remaining 4 tractors could plough the same field in 5 days.  

How many hectares a day would one tractor plough then?

### Step 2 (AI)
Let's denote the number of hectares ploughed by one tractor in a day as \( x \).

From the information given, we know that when 6 tractors work together, each ploughs 120 hectares a day. This means that the total area ploughed by 6 tractors in a day is \( 6 \times 120 = 720 \) hectares.

We are also told that 6 tractors can plough the field in 4 days. Therefore, the total area of the field is \( 720 \times 4 = 2880 \) hectares.

When 4 tractors work together, they can plough the same field in 5 days. This means that the total area ploughed by 4 tractors in a day is \( 4 \times x = 2880 \) hectares.

Now, we can calculate the value of \( x \) to find out how many hectares one tractor would plough in a day.

### Step 2.1 (TOOL CALL)
divide(a=2880, b=4)

### Step 3 (TOOL)
720.0

### Step 4 (AI)
If 4 tractors plough the field in 5 days, then each tractor would plough 720 hectares in a day. 

Therefore, when one tractor is working alone after two tractors are moved, it would plough 720 hectares in a day.

## Ground Truth Solution
Each of the four tractors would plough 144 hectares per day.
