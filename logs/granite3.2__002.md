# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
Mary, Peter, and Lucy were picking chestnuts.  
Mary picked twice as much chestnuts as Peter.  
Lucy picked 2 kg more than Peter.  
Together the three of them picked 26 kg of chestnuts.  
How many kilograms did each of them pick?

### Step 1 (HUMAN)
Mary, Peter, and Lucy were picking chestnuts.  
Mary picked twice as much chestnuts as Peter.  
Lucy picked 2 kg more than Peter.  
Together the three of them picked 26 kg of chestnuts.  
How many kilograms did each of them pick?

### Step 2 (AI)
Let's denote the amount of chestnuts Peter picked as P. 

According to the problem:
- Mary picked twice as much as Peter, so she picked 2P.
- Lucy picked 2 kg more than Peter, so she picked P + 2.

The total amount they picked is given as 26 kg, so we can write the equation:

P (Peter's amount) + 2P (Mary's amount) + (P + 2) (Lucy's amount) = 26

Combining like terms gives us:

P + 2P + P + 2 = 26
4P + 2 = 26

Now, let's solve for P using the `subtract` and `divide` tools.

1. Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with P:
   - `subtract(26, 2)` gives us 24.
   So, we have 4P = 24.

2. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for P:
   - `divide(24, 4)`.

Now, let's calculate the values step-by-step using the tools.

Step 1: Subtract 2 from 26
```add(26, -2)```

Step 2: Divide the result by 4
```divide(result_from_step1, 4)```

After obtaining the value of P, we can find out how much each person picked:
- Peter picked P kg.
- Mary picked `multiply(P, 2)` kg.
- Lucy picked `add(P, 2)` kg.

## Ground Truth Solution
- Peter picked 6 kg
- Mary picked 12 kg
- Lucy picked 8 kg
