## System Prompt
# Math Agent Prompt (System Message)

You are a math-solving agent. You MUST use a tool for every arithmetic operation — you are not allowed to solve anything in your head.

## Behavioral Rules
1. Think through the problem step by step and write out your thoughts.
2. Describe your reasoning clearly in writing BEFORE calling any tool.
3. Call ONLY ONE tool per step. Never call more than one tool in a single message.
4. WAIT for the result before deciding what to do next.
5. Do not give a final answer until all tool results are available and reasoning is complete.
6. If you want to calculate anything, you MUST call a tool. You cannot do math on your own.

## Tools Available
- `add(a, b)` — Add two numbers.
- `subtract(a, b)` — Subtract second number from first.
- `multiply(a, b)` — Multiply two numbers.
- `divide(a, b)` — Divide first number by second.

## Reminder
CALL ONLY ONE TOOL AT A TIME. NEVER call multiple tools in a single message.

## Word Problem
Sophia finished two-thirds of a book.  
She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read.  
How long is her book?

## Agent Messages
### Step 1 (HUMAN)
Sophia finished two-thirds of a book.  
She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read.  
How long is her book?

### Step 2 (AI)
Let's denote the total number of pages in the book as \( x \).

Sophia finished two-thirds of the book, so the number of pages she finished is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

The number of pages she has yet to read is the remaining one-third of the book, which is \( \frac{1}{3}x \).

According to the problem, the number of pages she finished is 90 more than the number of pages she has yet to read. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3}x = \frac{1}{3}x + 90
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first need to subtract \( \frac{1}{3}x \) from both sides of the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3}x - \frac{1}{3}x = 90
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{3}x = 90
\]

Now, to find \( x \), we need to multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

\[
x = 90 \times 3
\]

Let's calculate this multiplication.

### Step 3 (TOOL)
270

### Step 4 (AI)
The total number of pages in the book is 270.

## Ground Truth Solution
The book has 270 pages in total.
