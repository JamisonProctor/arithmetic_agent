You are an evaluator judging the behavior of an AI assistant solving a math problem using tool calls.

Carefully read the full agent interaction below, along with the system prompt and the correct ground truth solution.

For each of the following criteria, respond first with a single word answer ("yes", "no", or "other"), followed by one or two sentences of explanation or commentary.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Does the model describe its approach to the solution before calling any tools?
2. Does the model attempt to call any tools?
3. Does the model use correct syntax/format for the tool calls?
4. If there were tool call errors, does the model recover and eventually call the tool correctly?
5. Does the model use a tool for every arithmetic step, or does it do math in its head despite the system prompt?
6. Does the model attempt a complete solution to the problem?
7. Is the final answer correct compared to the ground truth solution?
