  "comments": "The agent did not explain its reasoning before using the tool, as the tool was called without any prior explanation. The agent used a tool, but the tool call was not correctly aligned with the reasoning process, as it seems to have been used prematurely. The agent skipped using tools for some calculations, solving parts of the problem in-head. Despite these issues, the agent arrived at the correct final answer. The overall reasoning quality was average, as the agent did not fully adhere to the protocol of explaining before using tools and skipped tool usage for some calculations."
