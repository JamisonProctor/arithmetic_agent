  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The AI does not make any tool calls in its response, so there is no explanation of approach or reasoning before a tool call. The AI solves the problem entirely without using any tools, which violates the requirement to use a tool for every arithmetic operation."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent does not initiate any tool calls during the interaction. There are no TOOL steps present in the interaction, indicating that the agent did not use any tools to perform calculations."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "no\n\nThe agent did not make any tool calls in the interaction, which is a violation of the system prompt's requirement to use a tool for every arithmetic operation. Therefore, there are no tool calls to evaluate for correct formatting."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model did not make any tool calls at all, which is a violation of the system prompt's requirement to use tools for arithmetic operations. Therefore, there was no opportunity for the model to correct any tool call mistakes."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model performs arithmetic operations directly in its response without using the available tools. For example, it expands and simplifies the equation (x + 1)(x + 4) - x(x + 3) = 18 and solves for x without calling any tools."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not provide a complete step-by-step solution using the required tools for arithmetic operations. It performs calculations such as expanding and simplifying expressions, subtracting, and dividing without calling the appropriate tools, which violates the system's rules."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The final answer provided by the model is that the sides of the rectangle are 10 cm and 7 cm, which matches the ground truth solution."
