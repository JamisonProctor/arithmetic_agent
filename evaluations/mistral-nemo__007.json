  "comments": "The agent provided a clear explanation of the problem and reasoning before attempting calculations, but it did not use any tools as required by the protocol. Instead, it solved the problem in-head, skipping the necessary tool usage. Despite this, the agent arrived at the correct final answer. The reasoning was logical and well-structured, but the failure to use tools as instructed is a significant oversight."
