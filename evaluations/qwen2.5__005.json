  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not provide any explanation or reasoning in its first AI response before making a tool call. It directly proceeds to call the tool without any prior description of its approach."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates tool calls during the interaction, as evidenced by the TOOL steps following the AI steps. Specifically, the AI calls the `add` tool in Step 3 and the `divide` tool in Step 6."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The tool calls are formatted correctly using the tool name and arguments, such as `add(a=102, b=138)` and `divide(a=240, b=2)`. Each tool call follows the specified format with the tool name and the required arguments."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent makes tool calls without providing any reasoning or explanation in the AI steps, which is a violation of the system prompt's rules. It does not correct this mistake in subsequent steps, as it continues to call tools without prior explanation."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model relies solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, as evidenced by the use of the `add` and `divide` tools for calculations, without performing any arithmetic directly in the AI responses."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not provide a complete step-by-step solution. It makes tool calls without explaining its reasoning or the steps it is taking to solve the problem, which is necessary for a complete solution."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The final answer provided by the model is 120.0, while the ground truth solution is 120. Although numerically equivalent, the ground truth solution specifies the answer as an integer, and the model's answer is a floating-point number."
