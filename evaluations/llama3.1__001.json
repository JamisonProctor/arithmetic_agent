  "comments": "The agent did not explain its reasoning before using the tool, as it directly provided a tool result without prior explanation. The tool was used, but the call was not shown in the trace, indicating a possible error in tool usage. The agent skipped using tools for some calculations, solving parts of the problem in its head. Despite these issues, the agent arrived at the correct final answer. Overall reasoning was clear but not fully compliant with the protocol."
