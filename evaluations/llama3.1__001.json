  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model makes a tool call in Step 3 without providing any explanation or reasoning in Step 2, which is the first AI response. The reasoning is only provided after the tool call in Step 5."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates tool calls during the interaction, as evidenced by the TOOL step following the AI step in Step 3, where the model calls the `divide` tool."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The tool call is correctly formatted using the tool name \"divide\" and the arguments \"a=360\" and \"b=3\" in the format specified (e.g., divide(a, b))."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model makes an initial tool call to divide 360 by 3 without explaining its reasoning or setting up the problem. Although the subsequent explanation aligns with the correct solution, the model does not correct the initial tool call mistake, as it was unnecessary and not part of the correct solution process."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model correctly uses a tool call to divide 360 by 3, but it then performs the division of 360 by 3 directly in its reasoning without using a tool, which violates the requirement to use a tool for every arithmetic operation."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model provides a complete step-by-step solution. It sets up the equation based on the problem statement, solves for the morning sales, and then calculates the afternoon sales, leading to the correct final answer."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The final answer provided by the model matches the ground truth solution, with 120 kilograms sold in the morning and 240 kilograms sold in the afternoon."
