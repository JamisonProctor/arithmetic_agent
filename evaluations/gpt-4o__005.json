  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model explains its approach by setting up the equation \\( 2x - 138 = 102 \\) and describing the steps to isolate \\( x \\) by first adding 138 to both sides and then dividing by 2. This explanation is provided before any tool call is made."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates tool calls during the interaction, as evidenced by the TOOL step in Step 3, which follows the AI's reasoning and setup in Step 2."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "no\n\nThe tool call in Step 3 is missing the correct format. The agent should have used the `divide(a, b)` tool with the appropriate arguments to perform the division, but instead, it directly provided the result without showing the tool call."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model did not make any tool calls to perform the arithmetic operations. Instead, it directly provided the result of the division without using the divide tool, which violates the requirement to use a tool for every arithmetic operation."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model correctly uses tool calls for all arithmetic operations, as evidenced by the division operation being performed using a tool call in Step 3. There are no calculations done directly in the AI responses."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model provides a complete step-by-step solution by first setting up the equation based on the problem statement, then isolating the variable \\( x \\) by performing the necessary arithmetic operations using the tools, and finally arriving at the correct final answer."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The final answer provided by the model is 120, which matches the ground truth solution. The agent correctly solved the equation step by step to find the number the student chose."
