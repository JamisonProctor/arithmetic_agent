  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model explains its approach by setting up the problem with variables for the speeds of the car and the truck, and it describes the equation that represents the situation before attempting to solve it."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent does not initiate any tool calls during the interaction. It attempts to solve the problem by performing calculations directly in its reasoning steps, which violates the requirement to use tools for arithmetic operations."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "no\n\nThe agent did not make any tool calls in the interaction. Instead, it performed all calculations manually, which violates the requirement to use tools for arithmetic operations."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model did not make any tool calls to perform arithmetic operations, which is a requirement according to the system prompt. Instead, it performed all calculations internally without using the available tools, and thus did not correct this mistake in later steps."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model performs calculations directly in its AI response without using tool calls. It expands and solves the equation for \\( v \\) and calculates the car's speed without calling any tools, which violates the requirement to use tools for all arithmetic operations."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not provide a complete step-by-step solution using the required tools for arithmetic operations. It performs calculations in its reasoning without making the necessary tool calls, leading to an incorrect final answer."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The final answer provided by the model is that the truck's speed is 90 km/hr and the car's speed is 95 km/hr, which is incorrect. The ground truth solution states that the truck's speed is 45 km/hr and the car's speed is 50 km/hr."
