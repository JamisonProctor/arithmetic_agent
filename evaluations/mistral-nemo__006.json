  "comments": "The agent explained its reasoning before attempting to solve the problem, but it did not use any tools as required by the protocol. Instead, it solved the problem in-head, skipping the necessary tool calls for arithmetic operations. The final answer was incorrect, and the reasoning process did not adhere to the tool-use protocols, resulting in a low reasoning score."
