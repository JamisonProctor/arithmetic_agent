  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "no\n\nThe model does not explain its approach or reasoning before making a tool call. Instead, it directly jumps into solving the problem without using any tools, which violates the requirement to describe reasoning and use tools for calculations."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent does not initiate any tool calls during the interaction. The entire solution is provided in a single AI step without any TOOL steps, indicating that no tools were used."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent did not make any tool calls in the interaction. Instead, it performed calculations directly, which violates the requirement to use tools for arithmetic operations."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model did not make any tool calls to perform arithmetic operations, which is a requirement according to the system prompt. It performed all calculations in its reasoning without using the available tools, and thus did not correct this mistake in later steps."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model performs calculations directly in its response without using the available tools. It calculates the value of x and the afternoon sales without making any tool calls, which violates the requirement to use tools for all arithmetic operations."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model provides a complete step-by-step solution, clearly explaining the reasoning and calculations needed to solve the problem. It correctly identifies the variables, sets up the equation, and solves for the morning and afternoon sales, leading to the correct final answer."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The final answer provided by the model matches the ground truth solution, with 120 kilograms sold in the morning and 240 kilograms sold in the afternoon."
