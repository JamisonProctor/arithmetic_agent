  "comments": "The agent explained its reasoning before using tools and used at least one tool. However, the tool call in Step 3 was incorrect as it attempted to perform a subtraction operation without using a tool. The agent skipped using a tool for this operation, which violates the protocol. Despite this, the agent arrived at the correct final answer. The reasoning was generally clear, but the incorrect tool usage affected the overall quality."
