  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model makes a tool call in Step 3 without any prior explanation or reasoning in Step 2. It does not describe its approach or the problem-solving process before attempting to use the tool."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates tool calls during the interaction, as evidenced by the TOOL steps following the AI steps. The AI attempts to use the `add` tool to solve part of the equation, indicating it is actively engaging with the tools provided."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "no\n\nThe tool calls are not formatted correctly. The first tool call uses an invalid expression `3*P` as an argument, which is not allowed since `P` is not defined as a numerical value. The correct format should involve only numerical values for the arguments."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model makes an incorrect tool call in Step 3 by attempting to use a variable \\( P \\) in the tool call, which results in an error. In Step 5, it repeats the same incorrect tool call without correcting the mistake, leading to another failure."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps. In Step 5, the model simplifies the equation \\(2P + P + (P + 2) = 26\\) to \\(3P + 2 = 26\\) without using a tool, which indicates it performed arithmetic directly in the AI response."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not provide a complete step-by-step solution leading to a final answer. It attempts to set up the equation correctly but makes an error in the tool call by using an undefined variable \\( P \\) directly in the tool call, which results in an error. The model does not proceed to solve the equation or provide the final answer."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent did not provide a final answer in the interaction. It attempted to set up the equation to solve for \\( P \\) but encountered an error in the tool call and did not proceed to solve the equation or provide the individual amounts picked by Mary, Peter, and Lucy."
