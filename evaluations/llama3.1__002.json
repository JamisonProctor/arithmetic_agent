  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not explain its approach or reasoning before making the first tool call. It directly attempts to perform an addition operation without any prior explanation or setup of the problem."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates tool calls during the interaction, as evidenced by the TOOL steps that follow AI steps. The AI attempts to use the `add` tool multiple times, although it encounters errors due to incorrect input formatting."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The tool calls are not formatted correctly because the agent attempts to use expressions like \"Mary's chestnut picking (2x)\" and \"Lucy's chestnut picking (x + 2)\" as arguments, which are not valid int or float values. The tool requires numerical inputs, not algebraic expressions."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model makes several incorrect tool calls and does not correct them. Instead, it proceeds to solve the problem manually without using the tools correctly, which violates the requirement to use a tool for every arithmetic operation."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model skips using tools and performs calculations directly in its AI response in Step 11, where it solves the equation and calculates the values for Peter, Mary, and Lucy without using any tool calls."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not provide a complete step-by-step solution using the tools as required. It attempts to solve the problem in its head and directly provides the final answer without using the tools for each arithmetic operation, which violates the system's rules."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The final answer provided by the model is Peter: 8 kg, Mary: 16 kg, and Lucy: 10 kg, which does not match the ground truth solution of Peter: 6 kg, Mary: 12 kg, and Lucy: 8 kg."
