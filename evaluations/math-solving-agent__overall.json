  "summary_comments": "The model demonstrates moderate proficiency in using tools, with a tendency to rely on them inconsistently. While it occasionally follows instructions to explain its reasoning before calling tools, there are instances where it skips this step, leading to a lack of clarity in its problem-solving approach. The model often attempts in-head calculations, which sometimes results in errors. With a correct final answer rate of 47.4%, the model's performance is below the benchmarks set by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, which typically exhibit higher accuracy and more consistent logical flow. Overall, the model needs improvement in maintaining a structured reasoning process and leveraging tools more effectively to enhance its problem-solving capabilities."
