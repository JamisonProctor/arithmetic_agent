  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. In the first AI response, the model does not provide any explanation or reasoning before making a tool call. It directly proceeds to call the `multiply` tool without any prior description of its approach."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates tool calls during the interaction, as evidenced by multiple TOOL steps following AI steps, such as the tool call in Step 3 after the AI's reasoning in Step 2."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The tool calls in the interaction are not formatted correctly. The initial tool calls in Steps 3, 5, 7, and 9 use variables or incorrect arguments that lead to errors, indicating improper formatting or usage of the tool's expected input types."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model initially makes several incorrect tool calls without correcting them. It only restarts the process after multiple errors, but it does not successfully call the tool to solve the problem in the provided steps."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps. In Step 11, the model correctly describes the arithmetic operation needed and then calls the `add` tool to perform the calculation, adhering to the requirement to use tools for arithmetic operations."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not provide a complete step-by-step solution leading to a final answer. It encounters multiple tool errors and restarts its approach without reaching the correct final answer."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "other",
    "comment": "Other. The agent has not yet provided a final answer, as it is still in the process of calculating the intermediate result using the `add` tool. The ground truth solution is 120, but the agent has not reached this conclusion yet."
