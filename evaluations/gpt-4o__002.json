  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model explains its approach by setting up equations based on the problem's conditions and describes the steps it will take to solve the equation before making any tool calls."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates tool calls during the interaction, as evidenced by the TOOL steps following the AI steps. The AI describes its reasoning and then calls a tool to perform arithmetic operations, such as subtraction and division, to solve the problem."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "no\n\nThe tool calls are not formatted correctly. The agent did not specify the tool name and arguments in the tool call steps; instead, it directly provided the result of the operation without showing the tool call format."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model correctly calls the tools needed to solve the problem without making any incorrect or incomplete tool calls. It follows the process step by step, ensuring each arithmetic operation is performed using the appropriate tool."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps. It performs calculations directly in the AI response when determining the amounts Mary and Lucy picked, specifically when calculating \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) and \\(6 + 2 = 8\\), without using the available tools."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model provides a complete step-by-step solution, clearly setting up the equations based on the problem statement, performing the necessary arithmetic operations using tools, and verifying the final answer to ensure it matches the given total."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The final answer provided by the model matches the ground truth solution: Peter picked 6 kg, Mary picked 12 kg, and Lucy picked 8 kg of chestnuts."
