  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model explains its approach by defining the variable \\( x \\) for the number chosen by the student and setting up the equation \\( 2x - 138 = 102 \\) to solve for \\( x \\). It clearly outlines the steps it will take to isolate \\( x \\) before making any tool calls."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates tool calls during the interaction, as evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps. For example, in Step 3, the model calls a tool after describing its reasoning in Step 2."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "no\n\nThe tool calls in the interaction are not formatted correctly. The agent does not use the tool name and arguments format (e.g., add(a, b)) for any of the tool calls. Instead, it directly provides numerical results without showing the tool call format."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent makes incorrect tool calls in Steps 3 and 5, as it does not specify the operation or operands for the tool calls. It does not correct these mistakes in later steps, as it proceeds with the solution without addressing the errors in tool usage."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps. In Step 3, the model skips describing the tool call and directly provides a result without using a tool, which indicates it performed a calculation without a tool."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent fails to provide a complete step-by-step solution. It skips the step of actually calling a tool to add 138 to 102, which is necessary to isolate \\( 2x \\) in the equation \\( 2x - 138 = 102 \\). The tool outputs in Steps 3 and 5 are not explained or connected to the problem-solving process, leading to a lack of clarity in the solution."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The final answer provided by the model is 120, which matches the ground truth solution."
