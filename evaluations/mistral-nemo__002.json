  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model explains its approach by defining variables and setting up the equation based on the problem statement before making any tool calls. It clearly outlines the relationships between the amounts picked by Mary, Peter, and Lucy, and sets up the equation to solve for Peter's amount."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates tool calls during the interaction, as evidenced by the TOOL_CALLS section where the model attempts to add and subtract numbers using the available tools."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The tool calls are not formatted correctly. The agent uses JSON format for the tool calls instead of the specified format, such as `add(a, b)`, which is required by the system prompt."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent makes an incorrect tool call by attempting to add 2 and 1, which does not correspond to any part of the equation it needs to solve. It then proceeds to make another incorrect tool call by subtracting 4 from 26 without correcting the initial mistake or properly setting up the equation."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps. It attempted to perform an addition operation directly in the AI response by adding the coefficients of P (2 and 1) without using a tool, which violates the requirement to use a tool for every arithmetic operation."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent does not provide a complete step-by-step solution. It starts by setting up the equation correctly but then makes an incorrect tool call by adding constants instead of combining the coefficients of P. Additionally, it attempts to perform multiple operations in a single step, which violates the system's rules. The agent does not reach a final answer."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent did not provide a final answer in the interaction. It attempted to solve the problem but made an error in the tool call by adding constants instead of coefficients of P, and it did not complete the solution process."
