  "comments": "The agent correctly explained the reasoning before using tools and attempted to use tools for calculations. However, the tool calls were incorrect as the agent did not use the correct inputs for the operations needed to solve the equation. Additionally, the agent skipped using tools for some steps, such as solving the equation for P. The final answer was not reached, and the reasoning was incomplete and flawed."
