  "comments": "The agent did not follow the protocol of explaining reasoning before using a tool, as it attempted a tool call without prior explanation. The tool call was incorrect due to invalid inputs, and the agent did not use any tools correctly afterward, solving the problem in-head instead. Despite these issues, the agent arrived at the correct final answer, but the reasoning process was not fully compliant with the given instructions."
