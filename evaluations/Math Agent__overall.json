  "summary_comments": "The model demonstrates a moderate level of proficiency in using tools, with a score of 7 out of 10. It generally uses tools correctly but occasionally makes errors in tool selection or application. The reasoning score of 6 reflects that while the model often explains its reasoning before calling tools, there are instances where it skips this step or performs some calculations in-head, which can lead to errors. The model's final answer accuracy of 69.6% indicates that it is somewhat effective in reaching correct solutions, though there is room for improvement. Compared to GPT-3.5, this model shows similar tool usage but slightly weaker reasoning and logical flow. It does not yet reach the consistency and accuracy of GPT-4o, which typically demonstrates stronger reasoning and higher accuracy. Overall, the model needs to improve its adherence to instructions and logical reasoning to enhance its problem-solving capabilities."
