  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model explains its approach by breaking down the problem into steps, detailing the calculations needed to find out how many hectares one tractor would plough per day when there are only 4 tractors working. It describes the reasoning before attempting to call any tool."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates a tool call in its reasoning process, as evidenced by the AI step where it describes its approach and then calls the `divide` tool. However, the tool call is incorrectly formatted, as it attempts to perform multiple operations in a single call, which violates the system's rules."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The tool call `divide(120, multiply(4, 5))` is incorrectly formatted because it attempts to perform two operations in a single step, which violates the rule of calling only one tool per step. Each tool call should involve only one arithmetic operation."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent makes an incorrect tool call by attempting to use `divide(120, multiply(4, 5))` in a single step, which violates the rule of calling only one tool at a time. The agent does not correct this mistake in a later step."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model performs calculations directly in its reasoning steps without using tool calls, such as dividing 120 by 6 to find that each tractor ploughs 20 hectares per day and calculating the total work done by 4 tractors in 5 days."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not provide a complete step-by-step solution. It incorrectly calculates the total work done by 4 tractors in 5 days as 120 hectares, which is the daily work of 6 tractors, not the total field size. This leads to an incorrect calculation of how many hectares one tractor would plough per day."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The final answer provided by the model is 6 hectares per day per tractor, which is incorrect. The ground truth solution states that each of the four tractors would plough 144 hectares per day."
