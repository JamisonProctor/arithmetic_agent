  "comments": "The agent correctly explained its reasoning before attempting to use tools, but it made an error by trying to use symbolic expressions directly in a tool call, which was not valid. After encountering an error, the agent proceeded to solve the problem manually without using tools for arithmetic operations, which violated the protocol. Despite these issues, the agent arrived at the correct final answer through logical reasoning."
