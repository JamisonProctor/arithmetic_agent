  "comments": "The agent did not explain its reasoning before using tools, which violates the protocol. It used tools but did not follow a logical flow, as it skipped explaining steps and seemed to solve parts in-head. Despite these issues, the agent arrived at the correct final answer. Overall reasoning quality was poor due to lack of clarity and protocol adherence."
