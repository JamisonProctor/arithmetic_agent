  "comments": "The agent explained its reasoning before attempting to solve the problem, but it did not use any tools as required by the protocol. It performed calculations in-head, which is against the rules. The agent arrived at an incorrect final answer, and the reasoning was flawed as it misunderstood the problem constraints. Overall, the agent failed to follow the tool-use protocols and did not solve the problem correctly."
