  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model explains its approach by defining variables for the pears sold in the morning and afternoon, setting up the equation 3x = 360, and stating that it will solve for x using division before making the tool call."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates a tool call with `divide(360, 3)` after describing its reasoning, which is evidenced by the TOOL step that would follow this AI step."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The tool call is correctly formatted as `divide(360, 3)`, using the tool name and the appropriate arguments within parentheses."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model correctly calls the `divide` tool to solve for x, which is the amount of pears sold in the morning. There are no incorrect or incomplete tool calls in the interaction provided."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model relies solely on tool calls for arithmetic steps. It correctly uses the `divide` tool to solve for x, adhering to the rule of not performing calculations directly in AI responses."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model begins the problem-solving process correctly by setting up the equation 3x = 360 and calls a tool to solve for x. However, it does not complete the solution by calculating the values for both the morning and afternoon sales, nor does it provide a final answer."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent has not yet provided a final answer. It has only set up the equation and made a tool call to solve for x, but it has not yet completed the process to determine the kilograms sold in the morning and afternoon."
