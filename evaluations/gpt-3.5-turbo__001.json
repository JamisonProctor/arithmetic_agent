  "comments": "The agent correctly explained the reasoning before using tools and arrived at the correct final answer. However, the tool usage was incorrect as the agent skipped showing the tool call for solving the equation 3x = 360 and directly provided the result. This indicates that the agent solved part of the problem in-head, which violates the protocol. The reasoning was clear but incomplete in terms of tool usage."
