  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model explains its approach by defining variables for the amounts of chestnuts picked by Mary, Peter, and Lucy, and sets up an equation based on the problem statement before making any tool calls."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates tool calls during the interaction, as evidenced by the AI step where it describes the plan to subtract 2 from 26 and then calls the `subtract(26, 2)` tool, followed by the TOOL step that would provide the result."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The tool calls are formatted correctly using the tool name and arguments. The agent uses `subtract(26, 2)` and `divide(<result_from_step_1>, 4)`, which adhere to the required format of specifying the tool name followed by the arguments in parentheses."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initially describes the steps it plans to take to solve the equation, including the tool calls for subtraction and division. It then correctly calls the `subtract` tool to perform the first step of its plan. Although the interaction ends before the division step is executed, the model's plan indicates it would have corrected any incomplete tool calls by proceeding with the division step."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model relies solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps. It clearly outlines its plan to use the `subtract` and `divide` tools for solving the equation and does not perform any calculations directly in its AI responses."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model begins to outline a step-by-step solution by setting up the equation and describing the steps to solve for P. However, it does not complete the process or provide the final answer for how many kilograms each person picked. The interaction ends before the model executes the tool calls and completes the solution."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "other",
    "comment": "Other. The agent has not yet provided a final answer, as it is still in the process of solving the problem by executing the planned steps. The agent has outlined the steps to solve for P but has not yet completed the calculations or provided the final answer."
