  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model explains its approach by defining the variables for the speeds of the car and the truck, setting up the equation based on the distance formula, and outlining the steps it will take to solve the equation before making any tool calls."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates tool calls during the interaction, as evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps. The AI describes its reasoning and sets up an equation in Step 2, and then proceeds to call tools in subsequent steps to solve the equation."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The tool calls in the interaction are not visible, and the AI steps do not show any tool call formatting such as `add(a, b)`. The tool outputs appear without any indication of the tool used or the arguments provided."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent makes incorrect tool calls in Steps 3, 5, and 7 without any explanation or correction. It does not describe its approach or reasoning before these tool calls, and it does not attempt to correct or clarify the mistakes in subsequent steps."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps. It skips the necessary tool calls and directly provides results in the AI responses, as seen in Steps 3, 5, and 7, where there are no AI messages explaining the reasoning or tool calls before the TOOL outputs."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not provide a complete step-by-step solution. It skips several steps, including the necessary tool calls and explanations for solving the equation \\(4x + 4(x + 5) = 380\\), and directly jumps to incorrect final answers without showing the intermediate calculations."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The final answer provided by the model is that the speed of the truck is 47 km/hr and the speed of the car is 52 km/hr, which does not match the ground truth solution where the truck's speed is 45 km/hr and the car's speed is 50 km/hr."
