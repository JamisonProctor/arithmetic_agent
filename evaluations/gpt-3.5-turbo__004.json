  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model explains its approach by detailing the calculations needed to find the total area of the field and the rate at which 4 tractors would plough the field. It sets up the problem and describes the steps it will take before making any tool calls."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates tool calls during the interaction, as evidenced by the TOOL steps following the AI steps. The AI describes its reasoning and then proceeds to call tools to perform calculations."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent does not use the correct format for tool calls. There are no explicit tool calls with the required format (e.g., add(a, b)) in the interaction."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent makes an incorrect tool call in Step 3 by not specifying the operation or operands, resulting in an output of 576.0 without context. It does not correct this mistake or make a successful tool call in a later step, leading to an incorrect final answer."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model performs calculations directly in its AI responses without using tool calls. For example, it calculates \\(6 \\times 120 = 720\\) and \\(720 \\times 4 = 2880\\) without using the multiply tool, which violates the requirement to use tools for all arithmetic operations."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not provide a complete step-by-step solution. It incorrectly sets up the equation \\(20x \\times 5 = 2880\\) instead of \\(20x = 2880\\), leading to an incorrect calculation and final answer. Additionally, the model does not clearly explain the steps it took to solve the equation."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The final answer provided by the model is 28.8 hectares per day, which is incorrect. The ground truth solution states that each of the four tractors would plough 144 hectares per day."
