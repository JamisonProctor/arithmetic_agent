  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The agent does not provide any explanation or reasoning before making the first tool call. It directly attempts to use a tool without describing its approach to solving the problem."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates tool calls during the interaction, as evidenced by multiple TOOL steps following AI steps where the model attempts to use the `expand` function."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The tool calls made by the agent are incorrectly formatted as they use an `expand` function, which is not listed among the available tools. The correct format should involve using one of the provided tools such as `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, or `divide` with appropriate arguments."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model repeatedly makes incorrect tool calls using a non-existent `expand` function and does not correct this mistake. Instead, it eventually abandons the tool calls and solves the problem using a different approach without successfully calling the correct tools."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps. In the final AI message, it directly calculates the dimensions of the rectangle (6 cm and 3 cm) without using the available arithmetic tools, which violates the requirement to use tools for all calculations."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model does not provide a complete step-by-step solution leading to the correct final answer. It attempts to solve the problem but encounters errors with the tool calls and ultimately provides an incorrect solution, stating the dimensions as 6 cm and 3 cm instead of the correct 10 cm and 7 cm."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The final answer provided by the model is 6 cm and 3 cm, which does not match the ground truth solution of 10 cm and 7 cm. The model's calculations and reasoning led to an incorrect conclusion."
