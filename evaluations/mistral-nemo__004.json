  "comments": "The agent followed the instructions well by explaining the reasoning before using the tool. It used the tool correctly to verify the final calculation and did not skip any tool usage. The agent arrived at the correct final answer, demonstrating a clear and logical reasoning process. The only minor issue was that the tool was used at the end to confirm rather than during each arithmetic step, but overall, the reasoning was strong."
