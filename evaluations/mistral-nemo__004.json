  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model explains its approach by outlining the steps it will take to solve the problem, including calculating the total area of the field and setting up an equation to find the number of hectares one tractor ploughs per day. This explanation is provided before any tool call is made."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates a tool call in the interaction, as evidenced by the AI step where it describes its reasoning and then proceeds to call the `divide` tool to confirm its calculation."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The tool call is formatted correctly using the tool name \"divide\" and the arguments \"a\" and \"b\" in the format `divide(a, b)`. The arguments are provided as a JSON object, which is consistent with the expected format."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model correctly calls the tool to confirm its calculation after describing its approach and reasoning. There are no incorrect or incomplete tool calls in the interaction."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "No. The model performs several calculations directly in its response without using tool calls, such as calculating the total area A as 2880 hectares and determining that 20x equals 2880 before finally using a tool to divide 2880 by 20."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model provides a complete step-by-step solution, clearly explaining the calculations needed to find the total area of the field and the number of hectares one tractor would plough per day in the second scenario. It correctly uses the tool to confirm the final calculation, leading to the correct final answer."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The final answer provided by the model, which is that one tractor would plough 144 hectares a day in the second scenario, matches the ground truth solution."
