  "Q1": {
    "question": "In the first AI response, does the model explain its approach or reasoning before any tool call is made?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model explains its approach by setting up an equation to represent the problem, defining variables, and outlining the steps needed to solve for the number of kilograms sold in the morning and afternoon before making any tool calls."
  },
  "Q2": {
    "question": "Does the model initiate tool calls during the interaction (evidenced by TOOL steps following AI steps)?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model initiates tool calls during the interaction, as evidenced by the TOOL steps following the AI steps. Specifically, the AI describes its reasoning and then calls a tool to perform the division in Step 3 and the multiplication in Step 5."
  },
  "Q3": {
    "question": "When the model makes tool calls, are they formatted correctly using tool name and arguments (e.g., add(a, b))?",
    "answer": "no",
    "comment": "no\n\nThe tool calls are not formatted correctly. The agent should have used the `divide(a, b)` tool with the arguments `divide(360, 3)` to solve for \\( x \\) and `multiply(a, b)` with the arguments `multiply(120, 2)` to calculate the afternoon sales, but instead, it directly provided the results without using the specified tool format."
  },
  "Q4": {
    "question": "If the model makes incorrect or incomplete tool calls, does it correct the mistake and successfully call the tool in a later step?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model correctly calls the tool to solve the equation \\(3x = 360\\) by dividing 360 by 3, and then it correctly calculates \\(2x\\) to find the afternoon sales. There are no incorrect or incomplete tool calls in the interaction."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Does the model rely solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps, or does it skip tools and do calculations directly in AI responses?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model relies solely on tool calls for all arithmetic steps. It correctly uses a tool to solve the equation \\(3x = 360\\) and another tool to calculate \\(2x\\), adhering to the requirement of not performing calculations directly in AI responses."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Does the model provide a complete step-by-step solution, leading to a final answer for the problem?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The model provides a complete step-by-step solution by setting up an equation, simplifying it, and solving for the number of kilograms sold in the morning. It then calculates the afternoon sales and summarizes the results, which match the ground truth solution."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "Is the final answer provided by the model the same as the ground truth solution shown at the end of the log?",
    "answer": "yes",
    "comment": "Yes. The final answer provided by the model matches the ground truth solution, with 120 kilograms sold in the morning and 240 kilograms sold in the afternoon."
