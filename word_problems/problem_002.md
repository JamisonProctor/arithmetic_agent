# Problem 002 â€“ Chestnuts Collection

## Problem
Mary, Peter, and Lucy were picking chestnuts.  
Mary picked twice as much chestnuts as Peter.  
Lucy picked 2 kg more than Peter.  
Together the three of them picked 26 kg of chestnuts.  
How many kilograms did each of them pick?

## Solution
Let `x` be the amount (in kg) Peter picked.  
Then:
- Mary picked `2x` kg  
- Lucy picked `x + 2` kg

Total picked: `x + 2x + (x + 2) = 4x + 2 = 26`  
Solve for `x`:

4x + 2 = 26
4x = 24
x = 6

Therefore:
- Peter picked **6 kg**
- Mary picked **12 kg**
- Lucy picked **8 kg**
