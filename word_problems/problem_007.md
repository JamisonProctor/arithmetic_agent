# Problem 007 – Rectangle Dimensions and Area Change

## Problem
One side of a rectangle is 3 cm shorter than the other side.  
If we increase the length of each side by 1 cm, then the area of the rectangle will increase by 18 cm².  
Find the lengths of all sides.

## Solution
Let **_x_** be the length of the longer side (in cm), so the shorter side is **x − 3 cm**.

### Step 1: Original Area
Original area **A₁ = x × (x − 3)**

### Step 2: New Dimensions
After increasing both sides by 1 cm:
- New longer side = **x + 1**
- New shorter side = **(x − 3) + 1 = x − 2**

New area **A₂ = (x + 1) × (x − 2)**

### Step 3: Set up equation
The new area is 18 cm² more than the original:
**A₁ + 18 = A₂**

Substitute expressions:
**x(x − 3) + 18 = (x + 1)(x − 2)**

Expand both sides:
- Left: **x² − 3x + 18**
- Right: **x² + x − 2x − 2 = x² − x − 2**

Set up equation:
**x² − 3x + 18 = x² − x − 2**

Simplify:
- Subtract **x²** from both sides: **−3x + 18 = −x − 2**
- Rearranged: **−3x + x = −2 − 18 → −2x = −20 → x = 10**

### Step 4: Final side lengths
- Longer side = **10 cm**
- Shorter side = **10 − 3 = 7 cm**

### **Answer:** The sides of the rectangle are **10 cm** and **7 cm**.
