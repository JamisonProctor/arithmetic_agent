# Problem 004 – Tractor Ploughing Efficiency

## Problem
A farming field can be ploughed by 6 tractors in 4 days.  
When 6 tractors work together, each of them ploughs 120 hectares a day.  

If two of the tractors were moved to another field, then the remaining 4 tractors could plough the same field in 5 days.  

How many hectares a day would one tractor plough then?

## Solution
Each of the 6 tractors ploughs **120 hectares per day**, so the total area ploughed per day is:

**6 × 120 = 720 hectares/day**

Since they worked for 4 days, the total area of the field is:

**720 × 4 = 2880 hectares**

Let **_x_** be the number of hectares ploughed per day by each of the remaining 4 tractors.

In 5 days, the total area ploughed by 4 tractors is:

**5 × 4 × x = 20x**

Set that equal to the total field area:

**20x = 2880**

Solve for **_x_**:

**x = 2880 ÷ 20 = 144**

### **Answer:** Each of the four tractors would plough **144 hectares per day**.
