# Problem 004 â€“ Tractor Ploughing Efficiency

## Problem
A farming field can be ploughed by 6 tractors in 4 days.  
When 6 tractors work together, each of them ploughs 120 hectares a day.  

If two of the tractors were moved to another field, then the remaining 4 tractors could plough the same field in 5 days.  

How many hectares a day would one tractor plough then?

## Solution
Each of the four tractors would plough 144 hectares per day.
