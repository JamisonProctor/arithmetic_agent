# Problem 001 – Pears Sales

## Problem
A salesman sold twice as much pears in the afternoon than in the morning.  
If he sold 360 kilograms of pears that day, how many kilograms did he sell in the morning and how many in the afternoon?

## Solution
Let `x` be the number of kilograms he sold in the morning.  
Then in the afternoon he sold `2x` kilograms.  
So, the total is `x + 2x = 3x`. This must be equal to 360.  
`3x = 360 → x = 120`

Therefore:
- Morning: 120 kg
- Afternoon: 240 kg
