# Problem 006 – Distance and Speed of Car and Truck

## Problem
The distance between two towns is 380 km.  
At the same moment, a passenger car and a truck start moving towards each other from different towns.  
They meet 4 hours later.  

If the car drives 5 km/hr faster than the truck, what are their speeds?

## Solution
We use the formula: **Distance = Speed × Time**

Let **_x_** be the speed of the truck (in km/hr).  
Then the car's speed is **x + 5 km/hr**.

Both travel for 4 hours before meeting.

| Vehicle | Speed (km/hr) | Time (hr) | Distance (km)      |
|--------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Car    | x + 5          | 4         | 4(x + 5)            |
| Truck  | x              | 4         | 4x                  |

Total distance:  
**4(x + 5) + 4x = 380**

Simplify:
- **4x + 20 + 4x = 380**
- **8x + 20 = 380**
- **8x = 360**
- **x = 45**

### **Answer:**  
- Truck speed = **45 km/hr**  
- Car speed = **50 km/hr**
