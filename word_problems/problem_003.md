# Problem 003 – Reading a Book

## Problem
Sophia finished two-thirds of a book.  
She calculated that she finished 90 more pages than she has yet to read.  
How long is her book?

## Solution
Let **_x_** be the total number of pages in the book.

- Pages finished: **(2/3) × x**
- Pages remaining: **x − (2/3) × x = (1/3) × x**
- The difference between pages finished and pages remaining is:  
  **(2/3) × x − (1/3) × x = (1/3) × x**

According to the problem, this difference is 90 pages:

**(1/3) × x = 90**

**x = 270**

### **Answer:** The book has **270 pages** in total.
